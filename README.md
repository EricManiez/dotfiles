# zsh_config
My ZSH configuration, along with git aliases and such.
Clone repo to Home directory, launch zsh_config_install.sh, and you're good to go.

Once you've checked the configuration works as intended, you can delete .zsh_save from your home directory.

If the script fails for some reason, you can reproduce its behavior quite easily :
  - put all the configuration files present in the Home folder in a new folder (as a "save point")
  - create symbolic links to point to fiels in the git repo
